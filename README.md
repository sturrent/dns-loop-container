# dns-loop

This is a set of scripts and tools use to generate a docker image to simply run a DNS query in a loop using curl and then plot a graph showing the resolution time.
The github actions can be used to trigger a new build and push the updated image. The actions will get triggered any time a new release gets published.

The dns-loop script will run the curl-loop script that generates output of each DNS resolution time iteration and will pass that output to hist from the https://github.com/glamp/bashplotlib tool.

### Using in Kuberntes
Sample usage in kubernetes

Deploy pod:
```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: dns-loop
spec:
  containers:
  - name: dns-loop
    image: sturrent/dns-loop
    command: ["/bin/sh"]
    args: ["-c", "while true; do sleep 1000; done"]
EOF
```

#### Run the script with the default values:
```
kubectl exec -it dns-loop -- dns-loop
```
Note: default values in dns-loop are
* Iterations = 100
* URL = google.com
* Sleep time in between queries = 0.250 s

#### Execution example with default values:

#### Running with custom values:
This is a sample run using 200 iterations, URL azure.microsoft.com, running the queries every 100 ms, and exiting non-zero if any single request takes longer than 1 second

```
kubectl exec -it dns-loop -- dns-loop 200 azure.microsoft.com 0.100 1
```
